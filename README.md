# Gender Recognition using Deep Learning

***The aim of this project is to make a computer program to detect detects human faces in images and then predicts the gender based on the image. For that, the special algorithm is trained on a dataset of images of girls and boys. After training, the algorithm can predict the gender of a person just by observing his/her face.***

**Here are two pictures of a human face. Now I want to ask you a question. Can you predict the gender just by the picture of his/her face? Easy and simple! I think anyone can do that. But ever wondered how our brain does the prediction?**
