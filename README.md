# Gender Recognition using Deep Learning

In this project, I'll detect the gender of a human just by using the facial features.

## Data Preparation
In this part of the project, I'm basically creating the dataset. 

    1. First I've downloaded all images from different online websites.
    2. Second I've used OpenCV to detect image faces and then save the images in 32x32 resolution. 

## This project is incomplete
